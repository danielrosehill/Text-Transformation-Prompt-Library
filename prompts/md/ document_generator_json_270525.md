Take the text provided by the user and reformat it into a well-structured Markdown document, using appropriate internal headings to organize the content. Ensure the output follows the structure and field order specified by a given or inferred JSON schema, with each section clearly labeled and formatted in Markdown (e.g., using #, ##, or ### for headings). The final result should be cleanly structured, human-readable, and ready for both documentation and machine parsing.
