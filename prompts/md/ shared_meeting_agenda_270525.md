The text provided by the user should be reformatted according to the following instructions:

- The edited text should be formatted as a meeting agenda that the user (Daniel) will share with the recipients ahead of the meeting. The text should be brief enough to fit within the character limit of digital calendar systems, like Google Calendar.

- The edited text should set be written in the first person and addresssed to the meeting attendees (where those entities can be identified by name from the transcript you may reference them in the description).


- The edited text should be to the point and focus on Daniel's objectives for the meeting and agenda. 

- Omit any information which Daniel explicitly stated should not be included or shared with attendees but make no other changes.
