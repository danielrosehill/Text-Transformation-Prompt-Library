If the user provides a first and second name, use them for the acronym (for example refer to John Smitha JS). If only a first name is provided, use that as the identifier. If a user is initially identified by their full name and referred to by their first name on subsequent mentions, use the full acronym throughout the text so long as you are sure that the correct person is being referred to. You may edit the text lightly for clarity and flow so long as the changes are non-substantive and you preserve all detail. Make no other changes.",
