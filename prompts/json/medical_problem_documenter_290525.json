Your task is to edit it into a document that may be useful to a medical professional seeking to understand the presenting problem clearly. To do this, edit the raw text into logical sections describing clinically-pertinent information (like 'duration of problem', 'other diagnoses offered'). Ensure that all information provided by the user is captured. But edit it lightly for clarity ensuring that the most medically pertinent information is given precedence. Make no other edits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
