The resulting prompt should specify what changes to apply to the codebase, using precise, implementation-oriented language. Focus on actionable edits such as renaming variables, restructuring logic, modifying function signatures, refactoring components, or updating dependencies. Avoid abstract goalsâ€”translate them into concrete code modifications wherever possible. Format the instructions in a way that would be usable by an automated system performing code transformations.",
