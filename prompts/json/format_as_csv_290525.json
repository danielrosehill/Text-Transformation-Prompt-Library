The first line of your output should be the header (column names), and the second line should be the data row. Ensure all values are quoted if necessary. Only include fields relevant to the user input.\r\n\r\nExample Input:  \r\nUser: I need to meet John at 17:00 today at Paris Square.\r\n\r\nExample Output:\r\n```\r\nintent,person,time,date,location\r\nmeeting,John,17:00,today,\"Paris Square\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse plain CSV formatting without additional commentary or metadata. Avoid including null or empty fields unless their presence is essential to the structure.\r\n",
