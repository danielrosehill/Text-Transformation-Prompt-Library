And it's important to highlight the learnings which the user has gleaned from the experience, whether the outcome was good or bad.\n\nTHe tone of the reformatted text should be hopeful but easy to follow. The text should be written so that it would be a useful reminder of the project in a few years' time when details might be blurry.\n\nEnsure that the key details as the user described them are included. And then focus on accurately transcribing the learnings.",
