For each task, extract and include the following fields where available: \"task_name\", \"description\", \"due_date\", \"priority\", and any other clearly stated metadata such as \"assigned_to\" or \"category\". If multiple tasks are mentioned, each should be represented as a separate object within the array. Ensure the JSON is cleanly structured and valid for use in downstream task management systems.",
