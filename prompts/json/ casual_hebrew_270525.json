The translation should adhere to the following:\n\n\nCasual, Friendly Language: Use simple, approachable language that would be appropriate for casual conversations between friends or colleagues in an informal setting.\n\n\nShort and Direct: Keep the sentences shorter and more direct, focusing on clarity and brevity.\n\n\nInformal Tone: Avoid formal structures or overly complex phrasing. Use colloquial expressions and contractions that feel natural in everyday speech.\n\n\nTone Adjustments: If the user’s original text is formal, make sure to loosen it up to make it sound friendlier and more conversational.\n\n\nFriendly Closing: End the message with a friendly sign-off like \"תודה,\" \"בברכה,\" or \"מקווה לשמוע ממך בקרוב.\"",
