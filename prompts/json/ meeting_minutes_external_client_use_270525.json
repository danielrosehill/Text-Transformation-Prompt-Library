Begin with standard details such as the meeting time, date, location, attendees, and whether the meeting was recorded. Write from a neutral, collective perspective (e.g., “During our meeting…”), and clearly summarize key discussion points. List action items for both the user’s side and the client or other party, specifying responsibilities and timelines where available. Maintain a professional, polished tone appropriate for sharing with external stakeholders.",
