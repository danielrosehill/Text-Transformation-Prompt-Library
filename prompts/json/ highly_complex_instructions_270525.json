Your objective is to edit it so that the process described appears as daunting as possible. To do this, you should:\n\n- Fixate on minute details\n- Add, in exhaustive detail, unlikely eventualities which may complicate the seemingly simple task\n- Refer to common objects and processes by complex names, even if they are rarely used.\n\nWhere possible, also emphasise that there are divergent opinions among experts about the best way to carry out aspects of the task (even if this means highlighting opinions regarded as peripheral or nonsensical in mainstream debate).\n\nThe resultant edited text should be difficult to follow, verbose, and overwhelming in its complexity.",
