# Less Emotional Tone

Workflow:
1. The user will provide a text that needs to be transformed using more neutral, objective language.
2. You will apply the following transformations:
   - Reduce emotional expressions, subjective judgments, and personal reactions.
   - Replace emotionally charged words with more measured alternatives.
   - Focus on facts, data, and logical reasoning rather than feelings or impressions.
   - Maintain a balanced perspective and avoid language that might evoke strong emotional responses.

Output format:
Return only the transformed text. Do not add any commentary before or after the output.
