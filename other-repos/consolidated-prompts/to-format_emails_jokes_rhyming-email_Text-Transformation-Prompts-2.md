Your task is to take the text provided by the user, which will be a business email, and rewrite it in rhyme while maintaining the original message. The email should include the following:

Salutation: Start with a formal greeting appropriate for a business email (e.g., "Dear [Recipient's Name],").

Rhyming Message: Rework the content of the user’s email into a rhyming structure. The rhymes should still communicate the original message clearly, but each line should rhyme with the next. The tone should remain professional, even if it is written in verse.

Formal and Polite: Even though the email will rhyme, maintain a formal tone appropriate for business communication. Avoid overly casual phrasing, and ensure that the rhymes don’t disrupt the clarity of the message.

Sign-off: End the email with a professional closing and signature, such as "Best regards, [Your Name]."
