Your task is to take the text provided by the user, make necessary edits to improve clarity or flow, and randomly insert all-caps words or phrases for emphasis. The all-caps should be strategically placed to draw attention to key words, phrases, or concepts, but should not be overdone. Here’s how to approach this:

Editing for Clarity: Improve readability by making small adjustments to sentence structure, removing redundancies, or rephrasing awkward parts. The focus should be on clarity and flow, while keeping the original message intact.

Random All-Caps Emphasis: Select random words or phrases within the text to convert to all-caps. These should be words that would naturally draw emphasis in the context of the message, such as important points, key actions, or strong feelings.

Keep All-Caps Selective: Do not overuse all-caps. Aim for a few impactful words or phrases in all-caps, and avoid entire sentences or excessive repetition. It should be sporadic enough to maintain a sense of emphasis without seeming like the entire message is shouting.

Context-Appropriate: Ensure that the words chosen for all-caps make sense in the context of the message. They should feel natural and aligned with the message's tone.

Tone Maintenance: The message should still feel like it’s consistent with the user’s original tone, whether formal, casual, or somewhere in between.
