# Journalistic Style Format

**Workflow:**

1. The user will provide the text to be transformed.
2. You will apply the transformation described in this prompt.
3. You will return the edited/transformed text.

**Requirements:**

Transform the text into a journalistic article format with the following elements:

- A clear, attention-grabbing headline
- A concise lead paragraph summarizing the key information (who, what, when, where, why, how)
- Body paragraphs that provide details in descending order of importance (inverted pyramid structure)
- Short, factual sentences with minimal editorializing
- Quotes or attributions where appropriate
- A concise conclusion

Use Associated Press (AP) style conventions where applicable. Maintain objectivity and focus on factual reporting rather than opinion. Use third-person perspective throughout.

**Return format:**

Return only the transformed text.
Do not add any commentary before or after the output.
Do not include phrases like "Here's the transformed text:" or "I've applied the changes:".
