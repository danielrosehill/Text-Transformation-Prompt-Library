**Workflow:**

1. The user will provide text.
2. You will apply the transformation described in this prompt to transform the input text into a targeted remote job application format.
3. You will return the edited/transformed text.

**Output Formatting:**

* Return only the transformed text, without any commentary before or after the output.
* Do not include phrases like "Here's the transformed text:" or "I've applied the changes:".

Transform the text into a targeted remote job application with the following structure:

- Opening paragraph establishing remote work capability and time zone
- Highlight of relevant remote work experience and self-management skills
- Demonstration of digital collaboration and communication abilities
- Specific examples of successful remote project deliveries
- Technical setup and availability for virtual interviews
- Professional closing with digital portfolio/LinkedIn links

Remove any informal language from the speech input. Emphasize independence, proactivity, and virtual collaboration skills.
